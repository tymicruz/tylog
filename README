This just needs node.js with node package manager (npm) to run
1)cd in project directory (@ level of index.html)
2)run command “npm install” (may take a little while)
run command this command in terminal “npm start”
3)make sure localhost:3000 is open for use
4)a browser window will open and display the app


NOTES:
-I didn't use a real data base (mock data) so refreshing the app will remove all data updates (users/posts/comments) that aren’t mock data.

-you can switch between users and retain data, but if you refresh the page, all updates will be lost

-I have preloaded 3 users (one admin), 10 posts and 50 comments.
This is the base for each time the app is run.
